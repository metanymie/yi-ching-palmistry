Experiment 3 for the class Creation and Computation

This project consists of a lazercutted acrylic box with an hand engraving, two small holes for photocels. When pressing the hand on the hand engraving, when the photocels are completely obscured, a random number between 0 and 63 is generated. This number is found in two APIs JSON, getting the character associated with the number, the title and the description. It is shown in browser with a cute background.
